## Background 

While browsing on Kaggle, I found this dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/game-of-thrones/data) that had a few files related to battles and characters from the popular (yet sadly unfinished...) book series *A Song of Ice and Fire*, which has been adapted for TV by HBO in the series *Game of Thrones*.   

**Note: Spoilers ahead!**

One of the data sets was on all named characters, their house allegiance, and death year (if applicable).  I thought it would be interesting to see which house had the highest percentage of living characters (of those named). Note that this contains both nobility and non-nobility (think Bran Stark vs. Hodor as an example of the former and latter - both aligned with House Stark).   

The results were interested and are *clearly* based on the books, seeing that the Tyrell's are the most lively house. If you are current on the show, you'll know that things didn't turn out so hot (or perhaps *too hot*) for the Tyrell family.  


```{r, out.width = "200px", fig.align= "center", fig.cap = "RIP Tyrell Family", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/bt0x/Documents/pictures/610_Sept_of_Baelor_Destruction_Promo.png")
```


Check out how the other houses are faring below! 



```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
#Death Ratio 
got <- filter(got, Allegiances != "None")

#add flag if dead 
got$death <- ifelse(is.na(got$Death.Year), 0, 1) 


#clean up allegiances to remove inconsistenty with "House" vs. not 
got$Allegiances <- str_trim(str_replace(got$Allegiances, "House "," "))



#summarize count by allegiances and death 
death.ratio <-     got %>% 
                      group_by(Allegiances, death) %>% 
                      summarise(count = n()) 

#get one record per house 
total.members <- death.ratio %>% 
                  group_by(Allegiances) %>% 
                  summarise(sum(count))

#dead members 
total.members.combined <-   inner_join(filter(death.ratio, death == 1),total.members, by = "Allegiances")

#rename columns
colnames(total.members.combined) <- c("allegiances","Death","deaths","total")

#add death ratio
total.members.combined$death.ratio <- total.members.combined$deaths / total.members.combined$total 

#add living ratio 
total.members.combined$life.ratio <- (1 - total.members.combined$death.ratio)
